NOTES

HOTFIXES



PRIORITY

instead of having user click anywhere on help dialogue, add an ok button to close it
replace help button icon with one without white edges around it, or try resizing it
need to sytle help and info dialogue text ie font, size, color etc
consider removing transparency from menus
consider replacing ok button in help menu with close x button

CLEANUP

can remove help.classList.add('help'); by changing .help selector to #help
look into whether or not to use id selectors
rename 'help' to 'help-menu'

GENERAL

if get undefined error when trying to access Token object, remember to
reference it's element property. pretty much whenever you want to manipulate a 
token through the DOM, you need to refer to the element property

if want to change stylling css properties of Token elements, need to do
tokens[this.heap][j].element.style.backgroundColor = 'green';

CHECKLIST

add license
choose on '' or ""
strict column/character width limit
beautify/clean up code by fixing comments removing debug code like console.log etc
maybe minify js code

check for jshint errros/warnings in all js, html, and css files
